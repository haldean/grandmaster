grandmaster is a lazy enumerator of the chess game tree.

This can be more useful than it sounds. The goal for the grandmaster project is
to be used to store the state of many games at once and allow for easy analysis
of these games. It stores games as pointers into the chess game tree, lazily
adding nodes to the tree as needed. In a sense, it is the git branching
model but for chess games. This allows for easy rewinding or forking off of
games, or speculative explorations of many branches of the game. It may also be
useful for chess engines, although having never implemented a chess engine I
can't be sure.

Right now, the status of grandmaster is that it parses algebraic notation
poorly. Many features here are missing, and the parser is probably more
permissive than it should be. There's also a basic PGN parser. A test framework
is half-done; you can run the half that's done by running "make test".

grandmaster is distributed under the GNU GPLv2. You can find the full text of
this license in the LICENSE file in this repository.

Building grandmaster requires GNU make; BSD make (and thus presumably other
POSIX-compatible make implementations not from GNU) do not support the
included makefile.
