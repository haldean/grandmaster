Installing grandmaster
------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the required dependencies:
    jansson (for JSON marshalling and unmarshalling)
        debian derivatives: apt-get install libjansson4
        openbsd: pkg_add jansson
        others: http://www.digip.org/jansson/
    check (unit testing framework)
        debian derivatives: apt-get install check
        openbsd: pkg_add check
        others: http://check.sourceforge.net/
    GNU make
        linux: almost certainly already installed
        openbsd: pkg_add gmake
    python
        linux: almost certainly already installed
        openbsd: pkg_add python

Building grandmaster requires GNU make; BSD make (and thus
presumably other POSIX-compatible make implementations not from
GNU) do not support the included makefile. This is because GNU
make is really great: life is better the wildcard transformation
rules and the ability to include Makefiles generated by gcc for
header dependency management.

To run the test suite, run "make test" (or "gmake test", if on a
non-GNU-by-default system). To create the gm binary, run
"gmake dist/gm".
